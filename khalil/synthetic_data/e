At the ODDO BHF Forum it was CFO Tom Bamelis presenting for listed family holding Ackermans & van Haaren (€ 3.67bn group equity). As usual, prime investor focus was on the recent developments in Marine Engineering (€ 1.15bn) and on the strong performance of the Private Banks (€ 1.43bn), with limited time left for the progress made in Real Estate (€ 0.47bn), Energy & Resources (€ 0.26bn) and Growth Capital (€ 0.35bn). Marine Engineering. Key news item over the past few weeks has been the announced demerger of offshore wind and dredging subsidiary DEME by listed construction company CFE, which is to be realised in H1 2022. This announcement has triggered a substantial rise in the share price of CFE from around € 90 to € 125+ / share, and pushing the marketcap of CFE up to € 3.2bn from € 2.2bn. For AvH’s 62% stake, CFE now represents € 1.95bn in the portfolio or € 58 per AvH share, which is up from € 41 / sh before the demerger announcement. Private Banking. With Assets under Management of more than € 60bn, a 9M gross inflow of € 4.1bn, and in Belgium still € 300bn of capital in savings accounts, AvH is optimistic on growth prospects. With a cost-income ratio of below 40% in the Belgian private bank, and just 52% for the group, the bank is generating lots of cash. With a tier-1 of > 40% in Delen, and 23% for the group, it has hundreds of millions excess cash available for M&A or future cash returns. Holding strategy. CFO Bamelis again reiterated AvH is investing for the long-term with a partnership approach, is actively involved in the board of its holdings, has limited holding costs (€ 13-15m per annum, with 30-40 people), aims for 10% return per annum, and has a stable growing dividend policy.

On track to meet its outlook

Ackermans & van Haaren repeated its Q3 outlook statement, expecting a record result (excluding capital gains) over 2021. AvH is happy to see that with the DEME demerger announcement, markets seem to start understanding what the underlying value is of the Marine Engineering segment. By increasing transparency of Private Banking they hope that also there the market will start to recognize the true underlying value.

Conclusion: Outperform, TP up to € 204 from € 180

Today we lift our Sum-of-the-Parts based target price for Ackermans & van Haaren to € 204 from € 180 per share, thereby still applying a 5% holding discount. Having recently lifted our 12m target for CFE to € 150 / sh from € 115, already explains € 15 /sh of this rise of our target price, and would value CFE and DEME together at around € 70 per AvH share. The Private Bank in our target price explains another € 80 per share, for AvH roughly € 2.7bn on € 200+m of expected earnings. As such expecting Ackermans & van Haaren to further benefit from improving market circumstances in offshore wind and dredging markets, and in the Belgian private banking market, as well as to further harvest some of its hidden gems, we reiterate our Outperform recommendation.

Grifols entitled to submit a squeeze-out for the ordinary shares

According to this publication and the fact that Grifols has surpassed the 95% threshold for the ordinary shares the company has the optionality of a squeeze-out of the remaining ordinary shares of Biotest AG in exchange for a reasonable compensation. This does not apply to the preference shares of Biotest AG.

~

Final closing of the deal expected in H1 2022

We believe the acquisition of Biotest makes strategic sense for Grifols and we expect the deal to be closed in H1 2022, although having the majority of the voting rights makes it pretty achievable to be closed (our estimates already consolidate Biotest from 2022 onwards). Biotest has a fractionation capacity of 1.5m litres expected to be increased to 3m in 2022 (Next Level Project). Grifols estimates revenue synergies of € 138m in 2024 and € 258m in 2026 coming from new products and opex synergies of € 65m in 2024, plus another € 10m by 2026. Excluding opex synergies and only considering 30-40% of revenues from new products, we factor in for Biotest a CAGR of +7% 2020-2026e sales, +11% 2020-2026e recurring EBITDA, with the recurring margin improving from 22% in 2020 to 27% in 2026. We calculate an equity valuation of Biotest excluding opex synergies of € 1.5bn using a 10-year DCF model (7.7% WACC, 2% terminal value), close to the offered price. The valuation would increase to € 2.1bn including the opex synergies, 36% above the offered price. The valuation of Biotest, is nevertheless, subject to the company obtaining enough plasma which makes the agreement with Grifols beneficial and necessary.

judge reply  Title: Grifols' Acquisition of Biotest AG: Strategic Sense and Valuation Implications

Date: January 10, 2022

Source: ODDO BHF Securities

Grifols to Acquire Majority Stake in Biotest AG
---------------------------------------------

Grifols, the Spanish multinational biopharmaceutical company, has announced its intention to acquire a majority stake in German plasma protein products manufacturer, Biotest AG. According to the agreement, Grifols will purchase 54.1% of Biotest's ordinary shares from CVC Capital Partners and the founding family for €1.6bn (€2.3bn including preference shares). Upon completion of the transaction, Grifols will be entitled to submit a squeeze-out for the remaining ordinary shares in exchange for a reasonable compensation.

Strategic Rationale for the Acquisition
--------------------------------------

The acquisition of Biotest strengthens Grifols' position in the plasma protein therapeutics market, which is expected to grow significantly due to an aging population and increasing demand for novel therapies. Biotest has a fractionation capacity of 1.5m liters, with plans to increase it to 3m liters by 2022 through the Next Level Project. The company's revenue synergies are estimated at €138m in 2024 and €258m in 2026, with opex synergies of €65m in 2024, and €10m by 2026.

Financial Implications for Grifols
---------------------------------

The estimated financial impact of the Biotest acquisition on Grifols is as follows:

At the ODDO BHF Forum it was CFO Tom Bamelis presenting for listed family holding Ackermans & van Haaren (€ 3.67bn group equity). As usual, prime investor focus was on the recent developments in Marine Engineering (€ 1.15bn) and on the strong performance of the Private Banks (€ 1.43bn), with limited time left for the progress made in Real Estate (€ 0.47bn), Energy & Resources (€ 0.26bn) and Growth Capital (€ 0.35bn). Marine Engineering. Key news item over the past few weeks has been the announced demerger of offshore wind and dredging subsidiary DEME by listed construction company CFE, which is to be realised in H1 2022. This announcement has triggered a substantial rise in the share price of CFE from around € 90 to € 125+ / share, and pushing the marketcap of CFE up to € 3.2bn from € 2.2bn. For AvH’s 62% stake, CFE now represents € 1.95bn in the portfolio or € 58 per AvH share, which is up from € 41 / sh before the demerger announcement. Private Banking. With Assets under Management of more than € 60bn, a 9M gross inflow of € 4.1bn, and in Belgium still € 300bn of capital in savings accounts, AvH is optimistic on growth prospects. With a cost-income ratio of below 40% in the Belgian private bank, and just 52% for the group, the bank is generating lots of cash. With a tier-1 of > 40% in Delen, and 23% for the group, it has hundreds of millions excess cash available for M&A or future cash returns. Holding strategy. CFO Bamelis again reiterated AvH is investing for the long-term with a partnership approach, is actively involved in the board of its holdings, has limited holding costs (€ 13-15m per annum, with 30-40 people), aims for 10% return per annum, and has a stable growing dividend policy.

On track to meet its outlook

Ackermans & van Haaren repeated its Q3 outlook statement, expecting a record result (excluding capital gains) over 2021. AvH is happy to see that with the DEME demerger announcement, markets seem to start understanding what the underlying value is of the Marine Engineering segment. By increasing transparency of Private Banking they hope that also there the market will start to recognize the true underlying value.

Conclusion: Outperform, TP up to € 204 from € 180

Today we lift our Sum-of-the-Parts based target price for Ackermans & van Haaren to € 204 from € 180 per share, thereby still applying a 5% holding discount. Having recently lifted our 12m target for CFE to € 150 / sh from € 115, already explains € 15 /sh of this rise of our target price, and would value CFE and DEME together at around € 70 per AvH share. The Private Bank in our target price explains another € 80 per share, for AvH roughly € 2.7bn on € 200+m of expected earnings. As such expecting Ackermans & van Haaren to further benefit from improving market circumstances in offshore wind and dredging markets, and in the Belgian private banking market, as well as to further harvest some of its hidden gems, we reiterate our Outperform recommendation.

Grifols entitled to submit a squeeze-out for the ordinary shares

According to this publication and the fact that Grifols has surpassed the 95% threshold for the ordinary shares the company has the optionality of a squeeze-out of the remaining ordinary shares of Biotest AG in exchange for a reasonable compensation. This does not apply to the preference shares of Biotest AG.

~

Final closing of the deal expected in H1 2022

We believe the acquisition of Biotest makes strategic sense for Grifols and we expect the deal to be closed in H1 2022, although having the majority of the voting rights makes it pretty achievable to be closed (our estimates already consolidate Biotest from 2022 onwards). Biotest has a fractionation capacity of 1.5m litres expected to be increased to 3m in 2022 (Next Level Project). Grifols estimates revenue synergies of € 138m in 2024 and € 258m in 2026 coming from new products and opex synergies of € 65m in 2024, plus another € 10m by 2026. Excluding opex synergies and only considering 30-40% of revenues from new products, we factor in for Biotest a CAGR of +7% 2020-2026e sales, +11% 2020-2026e recurring EBITDA, with the recurring margin improving from 22% in 2020 to 27% in 2026. We calculate an equity valuation of Biotest excluding opex synergies of € 1.5bn using a 10-year DCF model (7.7% WACC, 2% terminal value), close to the offered price. The valuation would increase to € 2.1bn including the opex synergies, 36% above the offered price. The valuation of Biotest, is nevertheless, subject to the company obtaining enough plasma which makes the agreement with Grifols beneficial and necessary.

At the ODDO BHF Forum it was CFO Tom Bamelis presenting for listed family holding Ackermans & van Haaren (€ 3.67bn group equity). As usual, prime investor focus was on the recent developments in Marine Engineering (€ 1.15bn) and on the strong performance of the Private Banks (€ 1.43bn), with limited time left for the progress made in Real Estate (€ 0.47bn), Energy & Resources (€ 0.26bn) and Growth Capital (€ 0.35bn). Marine Engineering. Key news item over the past few weeks has been the announced demerger of offshore wind and dredging subsidiary DEME by listed construction company CFE, which is to be realised in H1 2022. This announcement has triggered a substantial rise in the share price of CFE from around € 90 to € 125+ / share, and pushing the marketcap of CFE up to € 3.2bn from € 2.2bn. For AvH’s 62% stake, CFE now represents € 1.95bn in the portfolio or € 58 per AvH share, which is up from € 41 / sh before the demerger announcement. Private Banking. With Assets under Management of more than € 60bn, a 9M gross inflow of € 4.1bn, and in Belgium still € 300bn of capital in savings accounts, AvH is optimistic on growth prospects. With a cost-income ratio of below 40% in the Belgian private bank, and just 52% for the group, the bank is generating lots of cash. With a tier-1 of > 40% in Delen, and 23% for the group, it has hundreds of millions excess cash available for M&A or future cash returns. Holding strategy. CFO Bamelis again reiterated AvH is investing for the long-term with a partnership approach, is actively involved in the board of its holdings, has limited holding costs (€ 13-15m per annum, with 30-40 people), aims for 10% return per annum, and has a stable growing dividend policy.

On track to meet its outlook

Ackermans & van Haaren repeated its Q3 outlook statement, expecting a record result (excluding capital gains) over 2021. AvH is happy to see that with the DEME demerger announcement, markets seem to start understanding what the underlying value is of the Marine Engineering segment. By increasing transparency of Private Banking they hope that also there the market will start to recognize the true underlying value.

Conclusion: Outperform, TP up to € 204 from € 180

Today we lift our Sum-of-the-Parts based target price for Ackermans & van Haaren to € 204 from € 180 per share, thereby still applying a 5% holding discount. Having recently lifted our 12m target for CFE to € 150 / sh from € 115, already explains € 15 /sh of this rise of our target price, and would value CFE and DEME together at around € 70 per AvH share. The Private Bank in our target price explains another € 80 per share, for AvH roughly € 2.7bn on € 200+m of expected earnings. As such expecting Ackermans & van Haaren to further benefit from improving market circumstances in offshore wind and dredging markets, and in the Belgian private banking market, as well as to further harvest some of its hidden gems, we reiterate our Outperform recommendation.

Grifols entitled to submit a squeeze-out for the ordinary shares

According to this publication and the fact that Grifols has surpassed the 95% threshold for the ordinary shares the company has the optionality of a squeeze-out of the remaining ordinary shares of Biotest AG in exchange for a reasonable compensation. This does not apply to the preference shares of Biotest AG.

~

Final closing of the deal expected in H1 2022

We believe the acquisition of Biotest makes strategic sense for Grifols and we expect the deal to be closed in H1 2022, although having the majority of the voting rights makes it pretty achievable to be closed (our estimates already consolidate Biotest from 2022 onwards). Biotest has a fractionation capacity of 1.5m litres expected to be increased to 3m in 2022 (Next Level Project). Grifols estimates revenue synergies of € 138m in 2024 and € 258m in 2026 coming from new products and opex synergies of € 65m in 2024, plus another € 10m by 2026. Excluding opex synergies and only considering 30-40% of revenues from new products, we factor in for Biotest a CAGR of +7% 2020-2026e sales, +11% 2020-2026e recurring EBITDA, with the recurring margin improving from 22% in 2020 to 27% in 2026. We calculate an equity valuation of Biotest excluding opex synergies of € 1.5bn using a 10-year DCF model (7.7% WACC, 2% terminal value), close to the offered price. The valuation would increase to € 2.1bn including the opex synergies, 36% above the offered price. The valuation of Biotest, is nevertheless, subject to the company obtaining enough plasma which makes the agreement with Grifols beneficial and necessary.

Grifols entitled to submit a squeeze-out for the ordinary shares

According to this publication and the fact that Grifols has surpassed the 95% threshold for the ordinary shares the company has the optionality of a squeeze-out of the remaining ordinary shares of Biotest AG in exchange for a reasonable compensation. This does not apply to the preference shares of Biotest AG.

Final closing of the deal expected in H1 2022

We believe the acquisition of Biotest makes strategic sense for Grifols and we expect the deal to be closed in H1 2022, although having the majority of the voting rights makes it pretty achievable to be closed (our estimates already consolidate Biotest from 2022 onwards). Biotest has a fractionation capacity of 1.5m litres expected to be increased to 3m in 2022 (Next Level Project). Grifols estimates revenue synergies of € 138m in 2024 and € 258m in 2026 coming from new products and opex synergies of € 65m in 2024, plus another € 10m by 2026. Excluding opex synergies and only considering 30-40% of revenues from new products, we factor in for Biotest a CAGR of +7% 2020-2026e sales, +11% 2020-2026e recurring EBITDA, with the recurring margin improving from 22% in 2020 to 27% in 2026. We calculate an equity valuation of Biotest excluding opex synergies of € 1.5bn using a 10-year DCF model (7.7% WACC, 2% terminal value), close to the offered price. The valuation would increase to € 2.1bn including the opex synergies, 36% above the offered price. The valuation of Biotest, is nevertheless, subject to the company obtaining enough plasma which makes the agreement with Grifols beneficial and necessary.
